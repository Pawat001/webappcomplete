Reverend Insanity - Chapter 2: Going Back in Time with 500 Years of Experience

The academy examination hall was filled with nervous fifteen-year-old candidates. Among them, Fang Yuan sat calmly, his five hundred years of experience making him stand out like a veteran among children.

The first test was the aperture opening ceremony. In his previous life, Fang Yuan had opened a C-grade aperture, which was considered mediocre. But with his knowledge from the future, he knew exactly how to manipulate the process.

Using techniques he had learned centuries later, Fang Yuan managed to open an A-grade aperture, shocking everyone present. The examiners looked at him with new respect.

His younger brother Fang Zheng looked at him with admiration and confusion. "Big brother, how did you do that?"

Fang Yuan smiled coldly. In his previous life, he had genuinely cared for this brother, had protected him and helped him. But Fang Zheng had ultimately betrayed him, choosing the righteous path over family loyalty.

"Just luck, little brother," Fang Yuan replied, hiding his true thoughts.

The second test was gu worm compatibility. Again, using his future knowledge, Fang Yuan selected the optimal gu worms for his current strength, causing another stir among the instructors.

But the most important part wasn't the tests - it was what came after. Fang Yuan knew that in three days, the academy would organize an expedition to the flower wine monk's inheritance. In his previous life, he had missed this opportunity.

This time, he would be ready. This time, he would claim what was rightfully his.
