Reverend Insanity - Chapter 3: Please Go Aside and Scram

The news of Fang Yuan's exceptional performance spread quickly through the academy. His cousin Fang Zheng basked in the reflected glory, but others weren't so pleased.

"Fang Yuan, what kind of tricks did you use?" Mo Bei confronted him after class, surrounded by his lackeys. Mo Bei was the son of an elder, spoiled and arrogant.

In his previous life, Fang Yuan would have tried to explain, to avoid conflict. But five hundred years of experience had taught him that some people only understood strength.

"Tricks?" Fang Yuan looked at Mo Bei with cold indifference. "The only trick is that you're too stupid to understand real talent."

Mo Bei's face turned red with rage. "You dare insult me? Do you know who my father is?"

"I don't care if your father is the clan leader himself," Fang Yuan said calmly. "Please go aside and scram. I have more important things to do than waste time with trash like you."

The crowd gasped. No one had ever spoken to Mo Bei like this before. Mo Bei himself was so angry he could barely speak.

"You... you'll regret this, Fang Yuan! Mark my words!"

Fang Yuan simply turned and walked away. In his previous life, he might have worried about making such an enemy. But now he knew that Mo Bei would die in the beast tide three years from now. Why should he fear a dead man?

His brother Fang Zheng caught up to him, worried. "Big brother, was it wise to antagonize Mo Bei like that?"

"Sometimes, little brother, you have to show your strength. Otherwise, people will think you're weak."
