Reverend Insanity - Chapter 1: The Heart of a Demon Never Hardens

Fang Yuan opened his eyes and found himself back in his youth, in the familiar academy dormitory. The Spring Autumn Cicada had worked its miracle once again.

Five hundred years of memories flooded back to him - the struggles, the betrayals, the ultimate defeat at the hands of his enemies. But this time would be different.

In his previous life, he had been too naive, too trusting. He had believed in righteousness, in helping others, in the bonds of friendship and family. All of it had led to his downfall.

The heart of a demon never hardens - this was a lesson he had learned too late. A demon's heart remains soft and vulnerable, which is why true demons were rare in this world of cultivation.

But Fang Yuan was different. Through five centuries of bitter experience, his heart had indeed hardened. He was no longer the naive youth who believed in justice and morality.

This time, he would be truly ruthless. This time, he would let nothing stand in his way to the peak of immortality.

The path of the immortal was paved with the bones of countless others. Fang Yuan understood this truth now.

Looking around the dormitory, he saw his clanmates sleeping peacefully, unaware that among them slept one who had lived for five hundred years, one who had reached the pinnacle of power.

The academy examination was tomorrow. In his previous life, he had performed averagely. This time, things would be very different indeed.
